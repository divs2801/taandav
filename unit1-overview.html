            <h2>Unit 1 - Origin of Natya</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This unit delves into the origin of Natya (drama and dance) as described in Bharata’s Natya Sastra. The text begins with Bharata paying homage to Lord Brahma, the creator of Natya, and Lord Shiva, the creator of dance.</p>
            <p>Natya Veda, known as the fifth Veda, was created by Brahma at the request of Indra and other gods to guide humanity through an enjoyable and instructive art form, combining elements from the four existing Vedas. Natya encompasses moral teachings, intellectual growth, and the portrayal of both historical and mythological events.</p>
